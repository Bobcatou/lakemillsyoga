For some reason Elegant Theme "MyCuisine" can't have a fully functional child theme. When updating parent theme, you need to add code below to /includes/functions/sidebars.php updated parent theme. Putting this in the child theme doesn't work. 

if ( function_exists('register_sidebar') )
    register_sidebar(array(
		'name' => 'Notice',
		'before_widget' => '',
		'after_widget' => '<!-- end Notice Widget-->',
		'before_title' => '',
		'after_title' => '',
    ));
